Mod the Music for Rio Reincarnation

# Instructions
Detailed instructions can be found at my guide on steam: <link>

Convert 56 songs to .ogg format at 48kHz sampling rate. Run the python script and select the converted songs in the order you want.

Replace the original Bgm.pck with the one created by the script.

# Extras
A pack I made using this script can be found at: https://mega.nz/#F!6HhVSQgL!LOMuvu9xNF5OU9EjNP7Jmw

There are also replacements for the videos there where I used ffmpeg to replace the music.
